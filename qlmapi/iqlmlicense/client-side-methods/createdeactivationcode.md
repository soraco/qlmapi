## Remarks

A deactivation verification code is used to confirm that a user has indeed deactivated his/her license from a computer that is offline. If you are using your own user interface for activation/deactivation, you can use this function to generate a deactivation verification code. After the user deactivates his/her license, you need to display the code to the user and ask the user to send you that code.

You can then use the Deactivation code in 3 different contexts:

* When deactivating a key from the QLM Management Console / Manage Keys / Deactivate
* When deactivating a key from the QLM Portal / Release
* When deactivating a key from the QLM Self Help. To enable the DVC in the QLM Self Help, you must set the [Server Property ](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/207920563)customerSite/showDeactivationVerificationCode to true.

Note that a deactivation verification code expires in 1 day.

To create your own function to calculate the deactivation code, you need to compute the MD5 hash of the following concatenated strings

Activation Key (without dashes)|ComputerID|CommunicationEncryptionKey|Current date (yyyy-MM-dd)
