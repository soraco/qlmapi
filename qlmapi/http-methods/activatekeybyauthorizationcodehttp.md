# ActivateKeyByAuthorizationCodeHttp

### Description

Activates a license key over HTTP using an authorization code instead of an Activation Key.

When you call ActivateKeyByAuthorizationCodeHttp, you must provide the authorization code and the computer identifier (is\_pcid). The server does the following:

* Validates the license
* Verifies if the license has not been previously activated
* Activates the license
* Returns the computer key and the set of features that are enabled.

On subsequent calls to ActivateKeyByAuthorizationCodeHttp, in addition to the previous arguments, you should set the computer key argument using the value returned from the first call. In this instance, the server does the following:

* Validates the license
* Verifies if the license has not been revoked
* Returns the status of the license and the set of features that are enabled.

To invoke this method via a URL, append this function's name to the URL of the QLM License Server and add the required arguments.
